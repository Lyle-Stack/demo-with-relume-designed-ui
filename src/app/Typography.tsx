      <h1>The Joke Tax Chronicles for h1</h1>
      <p>
        (the first p tag) Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very
        lazy king who spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his
        advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of
        money.
      </p>
      <h2>The King&apos;s Plan for h2</h2>
      <p>
        (the second p tag) The king thought long and hard, and finally came up
        with <a href="#">a brilliant plan with an a tag</a>: he would tax the
        jokes in the kingdom.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &quot;After all,&quot; he said, &quot;everyone enjoys a good joke, so
        it&apos;s only fair that they should pay for the privilege.&quot; (You
        know it is blockquote tag)

      <h3>The Joke Tax for h3 again</h3>
      <p>Here is the ul tag with li tags:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
        <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
        <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (the forth p) As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the
        kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was one person who refused to let
        the king&apos;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named
        Jokester.
      </p>
      <h4>Jokester&apos;s Revolt, then this time for h4</h4>
      <p>
        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
        leaving jokes all over the place: under the king&apos;s pillow, in his
        soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he
        couldn&apos;t seem to stop Jokester.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes
        left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t help but laugh.
        And once they started laughing, they couldn&apos;t stop.
      </p>
      <h3>The People&apos;s Rebellion</h3>
      <p>
        The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to
        tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the
        joke.
      </p>
      <div className="mt-6 flex flex-col gap-6">
        <code>This is code tag style</code>
        <span className="lead">This is span.lead style</span>
        <small>This is a small tag style</small>
        <span className="large">This is a span.large style</span>
        <span className="mute">This is a span.mute style</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the error
        of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a hero,
        and the kingdom lived happily ever after.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good
        laugh and always be careful of bad ideas.
